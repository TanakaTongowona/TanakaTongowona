Tanaka Tongowona is a Data Science and Informatics student at Midlands State University. She is enthusiastic about her field of study as she is acquiring skills and knowledge on Machine Learning and programming languages like Python. Exploring how Data Science and Informatics can be used to solve everyday problems and other technologies out of my field interest me a lot. I am working on hands-on experience and on practical knowledge on front end development and Machine Learning.  I would like to explore and learn more in my field.
